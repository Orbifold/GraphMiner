# GraphMiner JSON Storage
 
This is a package which enables JSON storage and data management both in-memory and on disk. It works with Node and in the browser.
The API is Mongo-like and underneath sits LokiJS. 

The pro-version of GraphMiner replaces this storage with Neo4j, TigerGraph, MongoDB and other more scalable data solutions.
